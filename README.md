# XSS Scanner 🔍

**XSS Scanner** is a lightweight, user-friendly tool designed to detect and mitigate **reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities in web applications. This project aims to automate the detection process, offering developers a streamlined solution for enhancing web security.

## Features 🚀

- **Automated Vulnerability Detection**: Injects malicious payloads and analyzes server responses to identify reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on detected vulnerabilities, including exploited parameters and remediation suggestions.
- **Browser-Based Interface**: Operates as a browser extension, allowing for seamless integration and real-time testing.
- **Support for Multiple Payloads**: Utilizes a diverse library of payloads to maximize vulnerability coverage.
- **User-Friendly**: Minimal configuration required, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Launch the Scanner**: Initiate the tool via the browser extension.
2. **Enter Target URL**: Specify the web application or webpage to scan.
3. **Payload Injection**: The scanner injects various payloads into input fields or query parameters.
4. **Analyze Responses**: Detects if the payload was executed or reflected in the response.
5. **Generate Report**: Provides insights on identified vulnerabilities and recommended fixes.

## Installation 📦

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/xss-scanner.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd xss-scanner
   ```
3. Follow the browser extension installation instructions for your specific browser.

## Technology Stack 🖥️

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: JavaScript, JSON
- **Testing Tools**: Payload libraries, debugging frameworks

## Use Cases 🎯

- **Web Application Security Testing**: Identify and fix reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
